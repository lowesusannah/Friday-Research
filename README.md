# Friday Research - 12.15.17

#### By _**Susannah Lowe**_

## Description
_This morning, for the Friday assignment of studying or practicing skills we believed we still needed to refine, I first worked on my behavior driven development JavaScript project and my Angular week database application. Then this afternoon I focused on a few other topics that I thought needed attention. Here are resources I found and worked through._

## Resources

| Topic        | Description          | Link  |
| -------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Github repos | I pinned Github repos that I thought would show a good variety of my work to employers to try to get a start on the employment prep. work | https://github.com/lowesusannah |
| Markdown file formatting | I created this document as an .md file in order to practice  | https://github.com/lowesusannah/Friday-Research |
| Asynchronous API/Server Communication in JavaScript| I felt I still needed more study on this concept and the jQuery behind it, so I took Part 5 of this Vitamin T course.|  https://thegymnasium.com/courses/GYM/104/0/about|
| Social |I also thought a bit about the difference between my prior workplace environments and the ones I expect to enter into. I thought it would be useful to have a couple of strategies in my back pocket to more effectively diffuse situations should they occur. I looked up "mansplaining" as kind of a joke, but I did find some useful resources |https://www.thriveglobal.com/stories/12879-the-best-way-to-deal-with-mansplaining,

## Future exploration

_I'd like to continue looking for sources about asynchronous JavaScript, especially the separation between front and back end code while using ES6 syntax. I'd like to continue working with this as I complete my working doctor API search app and during the group project next week._
